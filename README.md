object-subset
=============

Object-subset is a tool to conveniently create a subset of a given tool by defining corresponding fields. This is incredibly helpful if you are serving an API or other end point that is fetching data from your MongoDB, Elastic Search or any other database that is at least able to return the results as JSON.
